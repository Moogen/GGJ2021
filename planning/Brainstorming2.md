# Brainstorming Session 2 - 1/29/2021

- Jeff's idea: have some interesting controls gimmick. Start with the gimmick idea (keep it relevant to the theme) and then work it back into the story.

## Ideas

1. Body Swapping
2. Randomized Maze thing - find yo way out
3. Have N levels that can be done in any order, but certain levels must be done before others in order to make progress. Puzzle game that requires the user to "find" the sequence of levels to do
4. Time trial you're losing your mind
   - Don't lose your way~~~in your mind~~~
5. Split Screen, 2 players wasd/arrow keys. Find each other! (josh is an idiot savant)
   - Jump! Jump! Jump!
   - Escape room style information passing/keep talking and nobody explodes
   - Gravity swap for other player!
   - Mechanics (e.g., openable doors) that are only accessible when you toggle the color of the background
     - Could be very fun visually
     - Certain things that can only be seen when you've changed the color. For example, green background with green text; toggle background to white or whatever

- How do we implement split screen technically? Can we run two scenes at the same time? Or do we need the rooms to be in the same scene with 2 cameras?
- Use room numbers on the walls to hint where they are in the maze. Minimal instructions!

## Decisions

- Keyboard + Mouse
