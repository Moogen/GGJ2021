# Brainstorming

Theme: **Lost and Found**

## Outline

- Vaguely inspired by Rome/Caesar's Assassination
- You wake up in a decaying "ancient" (vaguely Roman) civilization
- Story background: you used to be the ruler of the city/nation. A cohort of conspirators turned on you, overthrew your rule, and disassembled your body for parts. What remained of your chassis and your core were sealed away in a robot mausoleum. Many years pass and the mausoleum starts to fall apart. One day, an unsuspecting adventurer exploring the mausoleum accidentally reanimates your body. Now you are on the path of vengeance, aiming to hunt down the conspirators and reclaim your body.
- Each reacquired body part gives you a power up
- Need to figure out power up system
- The "first" fight will be against robo Servilius Casca Longus
- The "last" fight will be against robo Brutus
